## :book: Notes

It's been nearly six months since our last release, but we've been really busy.
We've made over 500 commits and attracted lots of new contributors.

There are lots of ways **you** could help NeoMutt.
Or perhaps you could [buy @flatcap a beer](http://paypal.me/russon) :smile:

#### Compose Multi-part Emails

Composing multi-part emails is easier than ever.

Compose shows you the layout of your attachments and allows you to make and
break groups, and reorder the parts in an understandable way.

[More details...](https://neomutt.org/guide/mimesupport.html#alternative-order)

#### Colours

For the last few releases, the colours have been neglected.
Now, they should be working correctly again.
